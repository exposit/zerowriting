# zerowriting
Scripts I'm tinkering with on my Pi Zero 2 for writing (as in "novel").

If you're here, you probably want [Zerowriter1](https://github.com/zerowriter/zerowriter1) instead.

Kindlestuff: stuff that's basically a very clumsy version of Solarwriter

Screen_LCD: setting up a pi zero with a small lcd screen (and dual oled panels) as a little portable writing deck. Testing my version now in the field.
Screen_eink: same as LCD, just with an eink screen (still very much in progress)

Typststuff: not uploaded yet but if you can't concatenate files and turn them into a shiny pdf are you even a Real Writer? (just kidding)
